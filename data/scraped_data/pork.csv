If the ends of the rack droop, the ribs are nearly done. If the rack remains stiff, the ribs need more cooking time, and if the rack breaks in the center and falls apart, they are overcooked.The video shows an easy way to remove the membrane from the bone side of a rack of ribs, an optional step I rarely take, but I did for this recipe.Feel free to try other flavors of soda with this recipe, like root beer or ginger ale.""]","{'Calories': '105', 'Fat': '6g', 'Carbs': '7g', 'Protein': '6g'}",https://www.allrecipes.com/cherry-cola-ribs-recipe-7547750
