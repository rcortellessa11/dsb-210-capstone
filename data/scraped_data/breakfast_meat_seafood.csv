Joseph's Best Easy Bacon Recipe,"Preparing this bacon is literally the first thing I do after I wake up on weekend mornings. I put the bacon in the cold oven, set it to 425 F, brush my teeth, start cooking other breakfast items, and then take the bacon out after 14 minutes — that's it! My theory is that by placing the bacon in a cold oven to start, as the oven gradually heats, the bacon undergoes a magical transformation from a cold, flabby piece of meat to crispy bacon heaven as the oven hits the 425-degree mark.",5 mins,15 mins,25 mins,6,['1 (16 ounce) package thick-cut bacon'],"['Line a large baking sheet with 2 sheets aluminum foil, making sure the sheet is completely covered.', 'Arrange bacon strips 1/2-inch apart on the prepared baking sheet.
